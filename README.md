# Support-System-design-In-Coal-Mine-Galleries-and-Junctions

A computational tool designed to assist engineers in determining optimal rock support parameters for underground coal mine galleries and junctions. This project presents a semi-empirical, computation-aided approach to design roof-bolt support using rock mass classification (RMR/Q) with simplified CMRI–ISM style rock-load relations.

## Features

- **Support Design Calculator**: Calculate rock load, effective support capacity, and recommended spacing based on RMR classification and bolt parameters
- **Grid Spacing Check**: Optionally enter a proposed bolt grid spacing and verify if it is adequate against computed maximum spacing
- **Dark Mode Support**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Clean Modern UI**: Professional, minimal design with smooth animations

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS Variables for theming)
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS, no frameworks)
- Git & GitHub

```bash
npm run deploy:netlify
```

For detailed deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Development

### Local Development Server
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
# Server will start on http://localhost:3000
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## Configuration

- **Framework Preset**: Static Site (No framework)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (validates files)
- **Output Directory**: `.` (current directory)
- **Environment Variables**: See `_env.example` and `config.js`

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Enter the required parameters:
   - RMR (0-100)
   - Roof Thickness t (m)
   - Bolt Capacity Cb (kN)
   - Factor of Safety (FoS)
   - Bolt efficiency ηb
   - Plate efficiency ηp
   - Proposed grid spacing Sg (optional)
   - Location (Gallery/Junction)
3. Click "Check" to calculate results
4. View the calculated rock load, effective capacity, spacing, support density, and optional grid adequacy check

## Calculation Formulas

- **Rock Load**: RL = 0.1 × (100 − RMR) × t (t/m²)
- **Effective Capacity (kN)**: C_eff(kN) = C_b × η_b × η_p
- **Effective Capacity (t)**: C_eff(t) = C_eff(kN) / 9.80665
- **Spacing**: S = √(C_eff(t) / (RL × FoS × J_f))
- **Support Density**: C_eff(t) / S²
- **Achieved FoS at Proposed Grid**: C_eff(t) / (RL × Jf × Sg²)
